# Fine-tuning LLMs using PEFT-LoRA 

## Introduction
In today's business landscape, we are surrounded by a wealth of opportunities to utilize advanced technology. Think of large language models(LLMs) as versatile tools in our toolkit: we can customize them for a variety of specific downstream tasks, a process known as "fine-tuning". However, a challenge arises in that each fine-tuned model typically maintains the same parameter size as the original. Therefore, managing multiple fine-tuned models requires careful consideration of factors like memory management, power consumption, inference latency, and disk utilization.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a streamlined way to adapt pre-trained LLMs, often referred to as the *base models*, for a variety of specific downstream tasks. These tasks can include applications such like text summarization, question answering, image generation. Traditional full fine-tuning of all parameters in a base model demands substantial computational resources. In contrast, PEFT approaches concentrate on optimizing a significantly smaller subset of parameters, commonly known as adapters. These adapters are designed to work in tandem with the unchanged base model, allowing for tailored product experience for each specific use case. Moreover, recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SoTA) PEFT methods have shown that they can achieve performance levels comparable to those of fully fine-tuned base models, but with a fraction of the computational and storage overhead. 

To illustrate, I've shared a sample Colab notebook that guides through a straightforward PEFT process via LoRA ([Low-Rank Adaptation](https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf)), utilizing the [libraries developed by HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/peft). This approach exemplifies how PEFT can optimize the fine-tuning experiments of LLMs in a resource-efficient manner.
